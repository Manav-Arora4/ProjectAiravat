# Project Airavat - YOLOv11 Cone Detection
Team OutPulse | International Space Drone Competition (ISDC)

ðŸ“Œ Overview
Project Airavat is a YOLOv11-based model trained to detect cones used as markers in the International Space Drone Competition (ISDC). This repository contains the trained model, dataset, and scripts for training and real-time inference.

ðŸš€ Features
YOLOv11-based cone detection model
Trained on a custom dataset with labeled images
Supports real-time and image-based inference
Includes training and utility scripts
